Vebash is a Data Analytics professional from South Africa. She pretty much loves anything about data, yes, even data wrangling and munging, since she learns so much from that process! She has a background in Computer Science and Applied Math. She also has an MBA since she is interested in technical leadership.

The thing that drives her, is getting more girls and women into STEM related fields, and towards that goal she is the organiser of RLadies in Johannesburg to promote the use of the R programming language among women and minority genders. RLadies Jozi are most interested in building a community, and lifting up women and minority genders as much as we can, so please do join us if you're available.

When not building data products, you'll find her watching Gilmore Girls on repeat, listening to story-like podcasts, as well as stories by a growing kid (currently 5yo) with a fun imagination - which sometimes results in playing make believe, in some far out situations ðŸ˜ƒ
