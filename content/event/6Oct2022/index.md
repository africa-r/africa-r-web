summary: 


abstract: 'Data wrangling is an essential step in the data science workflow as over 60% of the time is spent wrangling/munging the data before modeling and communicating insights. Dplyr a member of the tidyverse meta-package in R makes data wrangling come to life with the array of verbs from the filter; select; mutate among others. I will share a workflow of how I used these verbs for data wrangling on a transport analytics project.'

### Topic: Data Wrangling with Dplyr Package

Data wrangling is an essential step in the data science workflow as over 60% of the time is spent wrangling/munging the data before modeling and communicating insights. Dplyr a member of the tidyverse meta-package in R makes data wrangling come to life with the array of verbs from the filter; select; mutate among others. I will share a workflow of how I used these verbs for data wrangling on a transport analytics project.
