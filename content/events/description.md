In September 2022 we are kicking off a new series of community meetups that will take place on the **FIRST THURSDAY** of each month. During these meetups there will be an opportunity to introduce yourself and share information about your work and interest in R programming. At each monthly meetup we will invite a community member to share how they have recently used R in their work. The talk will include a code-walkthrough to give community members the opportunity to learn, give feedback, and re-use existing code.

For a full list of speakers and topics or to sign up as speaker, please see our [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PyfUEDbw0MXqs0jh37aqBHCKQ6W_qAF7iMRt145xoQo/edit).
