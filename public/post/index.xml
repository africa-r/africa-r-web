&lt;p&gt;Authors: Anicet Ebou (on behalf of AfricaR Core Team) and Danielle Smalls (on behalf of MiR Leadership)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are extremely excited to announce that organizers from &lt;a href=&#34;https://africa-r.org&#34;&gt;AfricaR&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@doritolay/introducing-mir-a-community-for-underrepresented-users-of-r-7560def7d861&#34;&gt;MiR’s community&lt;/a&gt;, and R-Ladies will facilitate the online tutorial sessions for useR! 2020. In addition to taking deep dives into R topics from the tutorial experts, useR! 2020 attendees will have the opportunity to meet inclusive community organizers and learn more about the communities they serve. We hope to increase the representation in attendance of members from these inclusive communities within the tutorial sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;africar&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;AfricaR&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
body {text-align: justify}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AfricaR is a consortium of passionate Africa R user groups and users innovating with R every day, who are inspired to share their experience as well as communicate their findings to a global audience. This consortium was born from the underrepresentation and minority involvement of the African population in every role and area of participation, whether as R developers, conference speakers, educators, users, researchers, leaders, and package maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a community, AfricaR mission is to achieve improved representation by encouraging, inspiring, and empowering the African population of all genders who are underrepresented in the global R community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary objective of AfricaR is to support already existing R Users across Africa, and R enthusiasts to embrace the full potential of R programming, through fostering a collaborative continental network of R gurus, mentors, learners, developers, and leaders, to help facilitate individual and collective progress worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AfricaR supports the R community in Africa by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating new R User Groups (RUGs): AfricaR provides guidelines and technical backup to facilitate the creation of new RUGs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publicizing R-related work developed by Africans, on twitter via @&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/AfricaRUsers&#34;&gt;AfricaRUsers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharing course materials that people can use to either start out or advance in R. We are currently working on tutorials in French to assist members from the francophone countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;mir&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;MiR&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MiR provides a space of belonging and support for people who identify as underrepresented minority R users (Mi-useRs). Our goal is to ensure that there are opportunities for the underrepresented. We also provide opportunities for underrepresented Mi-useRs to contribute to the R community in various aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MiR currently supports community members in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support for the RStudio Certification process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teaching exam presentation prep&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q&amp;amp;A with peers who are certified RStudio instructors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;MiR Slack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A space for Mi-useRs and allies to network and to share various professional development opportunities. Sign-up to join the slack group here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://bit.ly/2unAM8b&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://bit.ly/2unAM8b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;MiR member highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Newsletter, social media, and website highlights of members of MiR’s community and the work they do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope to uplift and empower the work of R users that are members from underrepresented communities that may include(list not exclusive): members of racial and gender minorities, members of the disabled community, and members of the LGBTQ community.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Guidelines for creating an R User Group</title>
      <link>/post/rugcreation/</link>

&lt;p&gt;AfricaR supports the R community in Africa in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creation of new R User Groups. An R User Group (RUG), is a group of people who come together to learn R. These can be students studying in the same university or people who live/work in the same city. AfricaR provides guidelines and technical backup to facilitate the creation of new RUGs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publicizing R related work developed by Africans, on twitter via @&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/AfricaRUsers&#34;&gt;AfricaRUsers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharing course materials that people can use to either start out or advance in R. We are currently working on tutorials in french to assist members from the Francophone countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have outlined a few steps that one could follow, to create a new RUG in their city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Create a leadership team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
body {text-align: justify}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are reading this guideline, it is probably because you want to create a R User Group in your city, meaning you will be the principal organizer of this RUG. We recommend that you really calculate the required time, involvement needed and the will to help people as a principal organizer of a local RUG, before jumping in. Leading an RUG involves teamwork, so you should consider creating a leadership team by finding 2 or 3 people that share your vision to create a local RUG. These people will help you to manage the RUG, especially when you need to take care of personal commitments. The leadership team should join the RUG organizers slack workspace, via &lt;a href=&#34;https://rusergroups.slack.com/join/shared_invite/MjEyNDA3MzcyMjczLTE1MDAwMzU1MTgtODRjNGJlY2RiOA&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Create social media accounts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The R community is more alive on twitter, than on any other social media. If you wish, you could create a twitter account for your RUG, naming it after your city eg &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;@CityXRUG&lt;/span&gt;. To engage with the global R community, follow the #rstats hashtag. You can find more information on how to engage with the R community on twitter, on &lt;a href=&#34;https://aebou.rbind.io/posts/2017/12/how-to-follow-and-engage-with-the-r-community/&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.t4rstats.com/&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.
A page on meetup.com would help you too and you can open one for free on meetup.com. You can also create a facebook account to draw local peoples to your RUG. Feel free to work with any social media page that you deem fit. Also, please follow @&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/AfricaRUsers&#34;&gt;AfricaRUsers&lt;/a&gt; ,so that we can spread word about the new RUG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Getting financial assistance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The R consortium, through its program to support RUGs, offers some financial aid and a meetup pro membership. You can find more information &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.r-consortium.org/&#34;&gt;on this website&lt;/a&gt; . Once you have a meetup account, please add your group &lt;a href=&#34;https://jumpingrivers.github.io/meetingsR/r-user-groups.html#middle-east-africa&#34;&gt;on this site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Organizing meetup events&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, when organizing meetup events, two things need to be considered: a venue and speakers. We recommend that you get in touch with universities, co-working spaces and other spaces that you can have, for free. This will help you mitigate the costs that come with running events.&lt;br /&gt;
The first event should be the launch event. Here, the leadership team would ideally introduce themselves to the participants. It would also be an opportunity to share the mission and vision of the RUG, and also inform people on the importance of learning R. You can also look for an external speaker, i.e someone who has been using R at work, for them to share their work experience with the participants. You can contact the &lt;a href=&#34;https://africa-r.org/contact/&#34;&gt;AfricaR leadership team&lt;/a&gt;, in case you need help looking for a speaker. The first event should then be publicized on social media. This is ideally done via posters, that detail information such as event date and time, speaker profile and topic of the event. You can reach out to the leadership team, so that we can help you create posters and also publicize the event on twitter.
Please see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Organising-Events&#34;&gt;R-Ladies Starter Kit&lt;/a&gt; for more ideas about planning the launch event and future events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incase you need further clarity, please do reach us through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://africa-r.org/contact/&#34;&gt;contact form&lt;/a&gt;, or send us a direct email via &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:africarusers@gmail.com&#34; class=&#34;email&#34;&gt;africarusers@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;r-in-africa&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;R in Africa&lt;/h1&gt;
Over the past 2 years, we have seen R transform from just an academic and health care research language to one of the major languages in the budding data science community in Africa. For a long time, data scientists and related disciplines have relied on R and many other packages to analyse data, however, the broader developer community didn’t fully understand its power in the tech industry. An effective model to enter the Africa developer ecosystem relies on a small group of enthusiasts creating a safe learning environment, documenting and sharing their learning experiences and slowly attracting interested learners. Africa R users group are using this model to introduce R as a language for data science by organising communities across different cities in Africa.
&lt;style&gt;
body {text-align: justify}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;evolution-of-chapters-and-representation&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Evolution of chapters and representation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth of technical talent in Africa positively correlates with the growth of communities around certain technologies/tools/languages. These communities are creating a long table to share opportunities on the continent. Seeing useRs evolve from just being groups of academic researchers completing their PhD or master’s degrees to attracting groups of people using R at their workplaces or for their freelance projects has given us confidence that R is part of the future of data science on the continent. When we direct the spotlight on chapters of useRs meeting up every other weekend across Africa, there is a theme of diversity that can easily
go unnoticed. This unique representation in the Africa R community shows how the useRs have created a safe space for equal active participation. Global communities like R Ladies and Women in Machine Learning and Data Science have put so many women in the community at a great centre stage of starting R user groups in their localities. The support from these groups has contributed to the early success of R user groups as the safest places to start your data science career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;our-future&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Our future&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R as a statistical programming language has a great value to the data science community on the continent and it is our role as useRs to show this value in our work, research and education. Our focus is on developing material that shows the amazing facets of R and renders it as an option on the table for potential clients and the community. R has been around for a quarter century and we are starting to see it cross paths with other programming languages thus raising a need to
create room for it in learning and early career choices. AfricaR is shining the light on R to build communities, mentor talent and power businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been 2 years 3 months since I have been affiliated with the Kampala R User Group aka &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kampalR?s=17&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@KampalR&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-it-all-started&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How it all started&lt;/h1&gt;
Alas January, everyone is excited about the new year, resolutions flying East, West and everyone eager and anticipating a year of greatness. For some of us, especially when you have been over a year out of campus and into the real world, it’s a time to reflect and rethink what direction you want your life to take.
January 2018 was that turning point for me, I loved the course I pursued at the university however I found myself in communications &amp;amp; marketing, a completely different field from what I had ever envisioned I would be doing and so so far away from my passion and what I really wanted to get my hands on.
That year I purposed to go back to my first love i.e computers and everything that comes along with it. That’s when the data science wave started sounding and sweeping over Uganda and after doing all the online research, I told myself this is it.
So the journey begins,
&lt;style&gt;
body {text-align: justify}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;kampalr&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;KampalR&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geared up, full tank I knew what I wanted so the next step was to find all the resources imaginable and start learning because over 2 years in communications had me on a totally new direction.
Checking up for meet-ups around the city and then I come across R user group, I didn’t have the slightest idea what R was, in fact to make myself feel better I imagined it was someone trying to fancy up a name for their meet-up.
Either way I registered because guess what the description had an &lt;strong&gt;Introduction to data science&lt;/strong&gt; and that’s what I wanted.
Walking into this room, I was the only lady in a room full of gentlemen and of course egos were flying, heads turning at this lady but I still sat (after-all it’s what I wanted, had to find a way to fit in).
That weekend, we had a lady facilitator which was cool of course and after the session, there was a bottle of soda and pizza. My mind was fully made up to return (partly persuaded by the pizza but also the session and the community).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joining KampalR community has been one of the best decisions I made to jumpstart my data science
career because despite the fact that I was the only lady for about 2 meet-ups before another lady
stumbled in: Her Excellency Ms Shakyrah (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cynthia_kyra?s=17&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@cynthia_kyra&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), I didn’t feel left out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community oozes inclusion, energy, passion and a deep desire to groom some of the best R users in the country. The people make it more perfect because each person in the community goes an extra mile so that their neighbour learns and also make sure no one is left behind.
The facilitators include everyone as much as possible and make the process to learn R as simple as possible.
It’s been 2 years since I joined the kampalR community, and I have not only learned R but also joined the force that makes this community meet-ups happen every month alongside &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/okello_mark?s=17&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@okello_mark&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as the lead and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cynthia_kyra?s=17&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@cynthia_kyra&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a co-lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have meet-ups organised at-least every month and always come up with interesting sessions to grow the community.
We have a slack channel &lt;a href=&#34;http://kampalr.slack.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;KampalR slack group&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where we discuss all things R and also communicate about events happening.
We have also introduced study jams where you can start from the basics all the way to your first R project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KampalR is open to everyone that is interested in growing their data science journey and learning R. Novice, intermediate, expert it doesn’t matter what level you are at, join the community and let’s grow together.
We also have the ladies group &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Rladieskampala?s=17&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@Rladieskampala&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where we can start our discussions with the latest hair style and plot the coolest graphs in R.
Want to learn more about the community and more stories from the community, follow me &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/nlimilimi&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@nlimilimi&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and follow &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kampalR&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;@KampalR&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to get the latest in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
